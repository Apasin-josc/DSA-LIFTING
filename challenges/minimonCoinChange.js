    5️⃣ CHALLENGE 5: Minimum Coin Change Problem
    ---------------------------------------------
    Given an array of coin denominations 'coins' and a target amount 'amount', write a function to calculate the minimum number
    of coins required to make up the target amount. If it's not possible to form the amount with the given coins, return -1

    Examples - 
        Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
        Output: 3
        Explanation: 11 can be formed using three coins: 5 + 5 + 1

        Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
        Output: -1
        Explanation: It's not possible to form 3 with the given coins

        Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
        Output: 0
