/* 104. Maximum Depth Of Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the 
root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example 1:
                (3️⃣)
               /    \
            (9️⃣)  (2️⃣0️⃣)
                  /      \
              (1️⃣5️⃣)    (7️⃣)
              
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2 */

const maxDepth = (root) => {};

console.log([3, 9, 20, null, null, 15, 7]);
